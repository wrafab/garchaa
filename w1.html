<H3> Week 1 | Struture and Design Challenges</h3>
<p> 
For our first 2 classes we participated in group based challanges. Our first challange required us to build the tallest structure possibe that would also be able to support a marshmellow. My group created a more sqaure bas struture, that had a triangle shapetop. Our main focus was support, so many of the limbs had double the material, allowing for stability. This approach would have won if it hadnt broke before we were able to present it. The 2nd challange had us build a building that would hold a cup up with just one string and see who could holld the most pennies. My group was Hayden , Fran , and Calum.
